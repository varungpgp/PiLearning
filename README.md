# PiLearning Library


The PiLearning Libary allows you to build and deploy machine-learned pipelines onto embedded platforms, like Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, micro:bits, and other microcontrollers. The deployed machine learning model runs on the device, disconnected from the cloud. Our APIs can be used either from C++ or Python. 

It's a work in progress, and we expect it to change rapidly, including breaking API changes. Despite this code churn, we welcome you to try it and give us feedback! 

A good place to start is the [tutorial](tutorials/vision/gettingStarted/README.md),
which allows you to do image recognition on a Raspberry Pi with a web cam, disconnected from the cloud. The  software you deploy to the Pi will recognize a variety of common objects on camera and print a label for the recognized object on the Pi's screen.
